							<h1><strong>About</strong></h1>
							<hr>
							
							<p>Hello, and, welcome to the World of Eric well I have had many years of technology experience. As of the beginning of 2014 I had worked at Best Buy for almost seven years for the first five just as a lead salesman on the floor. The last two were my favorite and thatâ€™s due to working in the Geek Squad as the Customer Service Full-Time Lead. Which that position allowed me to use my skills as well as learn some new ones. In this position due to my knowledge and love for technology they also had me train others who started in Geek Squad weather it was for customer service, troubleshooting products for functionality or to consult with clients one on one. Now as I step even closer to becoming a full stack programmer I find myself at geekwise learning and have achieved a level of knowledge that makes me confident in developing a website. </p>
